Contains the lab implementations of the algorithms covered in the syllabus. The course was taught by Prof. Shelley Zhang. This course was a pre-requisite placed on me by the university to familiarize me with the core CS principles of algorithm design and data structures.

Major algorithms/topics covered:

1.) Mergesort
2.) Quicksort
3.) Big-O Notations
4.) Prim's & Kruskal approaches to Minimum Spanning Trees(MST)
5.) Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
6.) Floyd-Fulkerson Shortest Path Algorithm
7.) Divide-and-Conquer Approach
